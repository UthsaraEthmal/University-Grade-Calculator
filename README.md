# University-Grade-Calculator
The program is designed to manage student progression outcomes based on their credit distributions. It offers functionalities for both students and staff. For students, it collects their credit details once and determines their progression outcome, saving the result to a file. Staff members can input multiple sets of credit details, with the option to add more or quit and view results. The program validates input to ensure credits are multiples of 20 and within the range of 0 to 120. It categorizes outcomes into "Progress," "Progress (module trailer)," "Progress (module retriever)," and "Exclude" based on credit distributions. It generates a histogram and a list of all outcomes for staff to review. File handling is implemented to save individual attempts and outcomes. Overall, the program provides a systematic approach to managing student progression outcomes while ensuring data integrity and user interaction.
